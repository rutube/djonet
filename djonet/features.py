    #     The database column type of a ForeignKey is the column type
    #     of the field to which it points. An exception is if the
    #     ForeignKey points to an AutoField / PositiveIntegerField /
    #     PositiveSmallIntegerField, in which case the column type
    #     is simply that of an IntegerField.  If the database needs
    #     similar types for key fields however, the only thing we can
    #     do is making AutoField an IntegerField.
